5.2.3

Advent Reborn Titan
   All missile weapons on titan can fire from any direction now.
      (They have the ability to control their missiles so I don't see why they wouldn't use the rear ones)
   Anima Missile Swarm now fires 2 missiles instead of 4. (Total damage is same.)
   Anima Missile Swarm on titan now requires the Anima Missile Swarm tech.

	Effects

Vasari Colony Capital Subspace Rupture
   Is now green and orange to better separate from gravity warhead and to match to vasari phase space effects.

Fixed some missing localization lines.

	Titans

AI will now build more than 1 titan at max fleet supply.
Titan Limit is now merged into fleet supply, so the AI actually researches it within a certain timeframe.
There's now an ability to start construction of a titan.
(This is mainly for AI use since they don't build more than 1 titan.)
It costs 50% more than a normal titan and cost is not reduced by research.
I do not recommend using it unless you're an AI as it'll also make any abilities chosen randomly.

	Items

Changed the GUI rows for capital ship items to be more even.

	TEC Primacy

The Ragnarov Titan now uses all of its missile bays per attack. (Because why wouldn't the Primacy)

Added additional descriptions to AI difficulty levels on game start screen.
These tell the players the AI difficulty are harder than base game by 1 difficulty tier.


5.2.1B

Advent Anime Swarm Missile Carrier
   Changed the PSI scaling for most of it's abilities.
   Most abilities scale 25% more from PSI.
   Heavy Anima Missile Swarm now also increases in Pierce with PSI now.

5.2.1A

Aluxians income and ship production is heavily scaled with how many planets they own.

5.0.8

Some effect changes. Mostly phase travel.
Advent Colony Capital Shield Regeneration no longer requires the ship to stop moving.

5.0.7

	Bug Fixes
Hull repeatables no longer increase cripple hull. 
	(Was the hull_cripple assert error when some unit was building. I assume a titan due to the timeframe it happens. Base TEC techs should be fine since the AI techs them before titans.)


	General
Fixed Advent Battle Capital Ship not having the right stats.
Defense structures range changed to 15000 for light defense and 17500 for heavy defense.
Pranast Armored Citadel item now gives +33% hull instead of crippled hull.

	Research Changes
Shield and Hull regen techs reduced to 10% from 20%.
In combat regen bonus reduced to 15% from 20%.
Point Defense and Structure Range techs have been reduced from 5 to 3 levels.
Most techs in the first tiers have been removed or moved.
    (It's messing with the AI and researching early game techs.)
	The last tech in altered trees now gives 2x to make up for missing techs.


	Neutral/NPC Factions
Capital/Titan ships for neutral/npc factions now have reduced XP requirements for level ups.


	Faction Techs
Most faction techs moved lower down the tech tree by 1 slot.


-TEC Primacy-

Trade Protection moved lower down in tech tree.
Added Insurgency tech that increases their durability.

-TEC Enclave-

Changed beam effects and shooting rates for less cluster of beams.
Defense techs no longer uses reduced regen cooldown.
	(Removing options to lower repair cooldown. When it hits 0 it completely disables the bonus regen in combat feature.)

-Advent Reborn-

    Advent Animus
	Instead of the tech having all stats on both techs each tech now gives set stats.
	(Bonus is same as previous techs, just not split across 2 and more readable)
	First level now gives 15% damage, 10 shields and 30% travel speed.
	Second level now gives 1 squad, 1 strikecraft per squad and -12 sec build speed.

-Advent Wrath-

Added new insurgency tech.

    Battle Regeneration
	Removed base regen increase.
	Regen in combat increased from 40% to 125%.
	Now lowers shield burst cooldown by 10 seconds.
	Now lowers max shields by -25%.

-Vasari Exodus-

    Exodus Hull
	Reduced hull bonus from 45% to 33%.
	No longer gives crippled hull.
	Now gives 150% bonus hull regen in combat and 100% base hull regen instead of 250% hull regen.

    TEC Armor
	Armor regen lowered from 40% to 25%.
	Now also gives 25% combat regen.


5.0.6
Removed research requirement for new exotic for the moment.
The AI apparently can't handle a T1 research being locked behind a T5 item and will just not do anything after a while.


5.0.5
	Research
Antimatter and Ability research tech amounts reduced by half but give increased amounts.
Reduced some connections of researches in the tree.

5.0.4
Ultimate Abilities now have 5 levels to use all level up points.
	Ultimate levels 4 and 5 are at level 19 and 20.
	These level ups only give 50% of level up stats per level.
	(Most ultimates would have to be completely rebalanced to do full level ups, which would make a lot of them less powerful the first 3 levels)
	

5.0.3
Added pip indicator on main hud for new exotic.

	Combat Regen Techs
In combat regen changed from 5% to 20% for each tech level.
These no longer reduce regen delay time as removing it fully makes the combat regen disappear.
	(Not sure if that's actually intended but probably a base game bug.)
Changed the in combat regen to additive from scalar since scalar doesn't actually enable the regen?

	Artifacts
Shield Capacitors changed to fit changes above.
Now splits regen amount from 125% to 62.5% base regen and 62.5% bonus combat regen.


5.0.2
	Bug Fixes/Text
Fixed Telekinetic Push giving bonus move speed instead of lowering move speed based on PSI.
Fixed some ability files missing autocast and gui features.


5.0.1

Changed Advent Reborn "Labor Negotiations" to a lower amount since patch changed the scalar from per 100 pop to per pop.


	Scenarios
Pranast Defense scenario now includes mod research.


	Exotics
Added Data Crystal Exotic to be used with repeatables.
	Cost and build time is 25% more than Green/Ultimate.
	Located in last slot in same research field as that races Green/Ultimate Exotic.
	Works better with AI in general as they don't waste all exotics on ships instead of tech.


	Research Rework
Fully reworked research positions and costs.
	Faction techs are now 50% cheaper instead of 25%. (Overall about same with new costs.)
	Research now goes left to right. 
	Requires new exotic instead of base game exotics. (AI was using them all on ships not tech.)
	Research costs and times based on slot instead of tier.
	Race/Faction techs do not require exotics.


	Research Changes
Military slot research reduced from 10 techs to 5. 
	Now matches bonuses of civilian version.
	Civilian version gives less price reduction but military now gives more.
Damage techs now have a branching tree.
	First 5 gives all stats, one branch gives weapon cooldown and other gives damage plus range.
	Total damage reduced from 150% to 125%.
	Total reload increased from 45% to 60%.
	Total range reduced from 75% to 60%.

Turned off Loot Collection for all neutral/militia/npc faction capital ships as it was crashing the game when they tried to capture the new DLC Ancient Starbase.


	Faction/Race Techs
	--TEC--
Added TEC Enclave faction tech for structures for civilian research.

Added new civilian faction techs for Reborn and Wrath.
Added 1 new military faction tech for Wrath.
	--Vasari--

Added Vasari tech for titan ability enhancements. Removed items from Vasari titans.

	
	General
Exotic Factories only require 1 building slot again, down from 2.
AI can build exotics slightly faster. [Right now I believe the AI is getting bottlenecked on exotics.]
	Hard - 2.5 secs.
	Unfair - 5 secs.
	Nightmare - 7.5 secs.
	Impossible - 10 secs.


	General Research
The start of all repeatable techs now require Green/Ultimate Exotics.
	[Race/Faction Techs not included]
	(This is to help the AI actually research base research first.)
Planet Item research now has another level.
	Costs 50% more and 2x exotics as level 1.
Culture Repeatable changed.
	Culture rate reduced from 10% to 7%. Now also gives 7% resistance as well.
Missile Speed research no longer gives missiles defense stats.


	Titans
Extra weapons are no longer an item, they're unlocked just through the research.
	Costs and times adjusted on research to be research + item.
	Visual changes from building item are now unlocked by default.

	Bug Fixes
Fixed rounding error with Advent Fighters damage.

	Bug Fixes
Advent Beam Defense properly set to 300 pierce instead of 350.
Fixed some duplicate artifacts not having duplicate in their name.
Fixed Vasari Vulrak Penetrator not unlocking its ability.
Fixed deploy starbase for all factions.


	General Research
Race and Faction techs were moved above repeatables.
Levels 5, 10 and 15 of Hull/Armor/Shields tech boost base regen in combat by 5%.
	This will allow partial regen on factions that don't unlock it until later.


	Research Times
Adjusted times to fit new research times of base game.
	Was 600/720/900/1140 based on tier.
	Now 1020/1140/1260/1380 based on tier.
Max Supply 5 & 6 now use base game costs for time/credits/metal/crystal but still require additional 2 & 4 exotics.


	Faction/Race Techs
Adjusted to 50% tier time and 25% reduced tier cost to promote AI use.
These also make the factions more unique so should be easier to acquire.
	--Advent--

Advent Race Tech for focus improved.
	Max Focus 20 to 25. Focus regen 0.1 to 0.15.

	Now 0.65 metal per cap and 1.5 metal per titan.
	Was 0.25 crystal per cap/titan ship.
	Now 0.2 crystal per cap and 0.5 crystal per titan.
Vasari Exodus get 2 more techs of above.
	(Each are 75% of above for a total of 150%)
Vasari Alliance get 2 new income techs as well.
	5% of all credits based on TEC base tech. (TEC is 20%)
	-8% trade cost and 8% trade sell value.
	

	Starbases / Defense
Defense structures now have 16000 range instead of 10000.
Any starbase weapon with less than 10000 range got boosted by 25%. 
Below are all weapons boosted.
	Starbase weapon ranges were balanced around not being able to move.
	Since they all can now the Vasari Starbase needed to be brought up to par.
		-Affects all Vasari Starbase weapons.
		-TEC Light and PD Autocannons/Beams.
		-Advent PD Laser.


	Conversions
Conversion techs have been deleted from the mod.
These may come back at a later date but with no way to lock them from AI use they just hinder the late game AI.



4.9.2a&b
	Bug Fixes
Fixed new Vasari Fighter to have correct weapon tags so beam research works on it. (This is a base game issue.)
Fixed Vasari Carrier Capital not having 8 items slots.

Changed build time for Titans. Exact times are chosen randomly at start within range.
	Easy - Was 150-240 mins. Now 120-180 mins.
	Medium - Was 110-180 mins. Now 90-120 mins.
	Hard - Was 70-120 mins. Now 70-100 mins.

	Nightmare - Was 50-80 mins. Now 50-70 mins.
	Impossible - Unchanged from 45-60 mins.
--(Let's be honest if you're using this mod you're probably looking for a challenge and not using many of the lower diffs)--

	General
Point Defense on Capitals/Starbases/Titans fire 25% faster.
Changed Advent small/light missile to have 1 health like the TEC and Vasari.
	(Base game has this at 5, not really sure why it's different than the other 2 small/light missiles)

	Research
Changed income per pop techs to an actual working planet modifier. (Apparently the empire version doesn't work even though it's there.)
Added 3 more levels of max planet pop and growth.
Reduced per pop income to 2 techs but changed from 10% to 15%.



4.9.1
	Scenarios
Added a set of basic units for scenarios so they get loaded on game start.
	These will have the effects and damage types of the original faction.
	The factions don't have different units in the base game so there's no way to have the default scenarios choose faction units.
	Anything built after game start should be proper units for the mod.

	Advent
With a now modular unity panel I added Transcendence to both unity factions.

	Research
Changed TEC Primacy Autocannon Barrage to scalar % damage instead of adding. (Same overall damage increase)
Added some basic population techs. These might change in the future.

	Added population income scaling techs.

	Bug Fixes
Enclave starbase level-up fixed.
Fixed some missing AI targeting for Capital Ships.
TEC Garrisons now build proper faction units.

4.9.0
	Updated to new patch
Most patch changes were applied, exceptions noted below.

	General
Defense structures no longer have a 50% boost in defense stats from base game. (Health, Shields, Etc)
With the recent buff to all unit and structure survivability this is extremely excessive.

Point Defense reverted to base game and will be re-evaluated with new defense stats on missile and strikecraft.

	Capital Ships / Titans
Shield burst restore cooldown and burst amount only levels up from 1-10 and does not increase past 10.
Crippled hull percentage only levels up from 1-10 and does not increase past 10.

	Taxes are 0%/5%/10%/20%/30%/45%/60%

	AI
A lot of abilities now focus Capitals/Titans/Cruisers/Starbases for ability selection.
	(Patch notes only mention Repair Cloud and Shield Regeneration but there's a lot more.)
Capital ships and Titans now ignore corvettes when attacking, at least AI wise.

	Leveling
Damage scaling and weapon cooldown per level up is changed in base game but not noted in patch notes.
	Too many changes to note here. All level up scaling numbers are different for every single ship.

	Rapid Manufacturing Ultimate deployed strikecraft increased from 25/31/37 to 25/34/43.


4.8.10
New patch didn't really change much so already version compatible.

	Changes
Lowered duration of TEC Enclave beam effects.
	With some of the higher weapon cooldowns with recent patches the beam effect pretty much never ended.
	Exception: Defense cannon uses 0.9 sec beam length as it has really low cooldown.
	Old: PD-0.25 sec / Light-0.75 sec / Medium-1.5 sec / Heavy-2.0 sec

	10% at level 10 and 30% at level 20.

	Carrier Capitals
Level ups now increase strikecraft build speed.
	4% per level from 1-10, 6% from 11-20.
	40% at level 10 and 100% at level 20.
	(With how build speed % are 100% build speed is only a 50% reduction.)
Levels 11-18 now give 1 squadron every 2 levels instead of 1 squadron per level.
	Levels 19-20 still give 1 squadron per level.
	Overall losing about 4 squadrons at level 20 for greatly increased recovery in battle.

4.8.8
Updated to new patch and current MEM.

	AI
Added Crystalline, Swamp and Ice Asteroid as colonizable types for minor factions.

	Artifacts
The new artifact will most likely not be getting a duplicate as it's similar to Zero Point Engine but much stronger as it's gravity well.
Exoforce Matrix now also increases ability range by 50% (Duplicate by 25%).

4.8.7
Added auto-cast improvements from the "Improved Auto Cast Logic" by Mar_Veloz.

4.8.3
Fully integrated MEM into mod. (Does not require MEM stand-alone)
AI changes will not apply if MEM is activated separately.

4.8.2

3.7.2
Updated changes for strikecraft for v28.16.
I don't use any of the point defense corvette files so these were automatically updated with the patch.

3.7.0
Advent Reborn Unique tech for ability cooldown buffed.
Increased to -30%/-50% from -15%/-30%. (This is effectively -40% cooldown, up from -25%)
	Due to how Sins uses %, -100% is actually -50%, -200% is -75%.

Advent Reborn titan ultimate "Unyielding Will" updated.
	Adding better PSI scaling. 0.01 / 0.015 per PSI. 
	Added lesser version of damage reduction from rebellion. This also scales with missing health.
	-20%/-25% base with 0.0002 PSI scaling.
	These bonuses are the max at near death, so most of the life it will be much lower.

Advent Wrath unique tech changed.
	All weapon cooldown reduced to -15%/-25%/-35% from -20%/-40%/-60%. (-75% from -120%)
	Plasma weapon cooldown added -25%/-35%/-45%.
	Cooldown reduction will work on plasma twice and is intended.

	Gives 250 base armor along with 15% armor instead of 25% armor. (This should scale better later)

3.6.0 (Missile / PD Rework)
The goal with this is to help deal with strikecraft but missile remain viable.
Added 0.33 base shield regen to strikecraft techs for vasari and advent, since default they will never regen shields.
Titans point defense damage 2x and cooldown reduced by 33%.
Capital ships point defense damage 1.5x and cooldown reduced by 33%.
Titan missile cooldown reduced by 30% and range increased by 20%.
Capital missile cooldown reduced by 20% and range increased by 10%.
Titan and capital missile pierce increased by 50.

TEC Hangar Defense flak damage 1.5x, cooldown reduced by 33%.
Starbase point defense damage 1.5x and cooldown reduced by 33%.
TEC Primacy missile tech adds 20 base armor to missiles.



Things of note

    Just because something has really high DPS does not mean it's "broken" or even deals a lot of damage.
    Damage dealt to a ship is calculated as 100/(100 + effective Durability) in %.
    Effective durability is (Durability - Pierce).
    A missile with 0 Pierce attacking 500 durability would deal mere: 100/(100+500) = 16.7% of its original DPS.
    Missiles may have high damage but may not always hit.
